<!-- ABOUT ORPHEUS -->
## About OrpheusDL

OrpheusDL is a modular music archival tool written in Python which allows archiving from multiple different services.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Orpheus up and running:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ (due to the requirement of dataclasses), though Python 3.9 is highly recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/OrfiTeam/OrpheusDL.git && cd OrpheusDL
    ```
2. Install all requirements
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the program at least once, or use this command to create the settings file
   ```shell
   python3 orpheus.py settings refresh
   ```
4. Enter your credentials in `config/settings.json`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Just call `orpheus.py` with any link you want to archive, for example Qobuz:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py https://open.qobuz.com/album/c9wsrrjh49ftb
```

Alternatively do a search (luckysearch to automatically select the first option):
```shell
python3 orpheus.py search qobuz track darkside alan walker
```

Or if you have the ID of what you want to download, use:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py download qobuz track 52151405
```

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

You can customize every module from Orpheus individually and also set general/global settings which are active in every
loaded module. You'll find the configuration file here: `config/settings.json`

### Global/General
```json5
{
    "download_path": "./downloads/",
    "download_quality": "hifi",
    "search_limit": 10
}
```

`download_path`: Set the absolute or relative output path with `/` as the delimiter

`download_quality`: Choose one of the following settings:
* "hifi": FLAC higher than 44.1/16 if available
* "lossless": FLAC with 44.1/16 if available
* "high": lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a higher bitrate
* "medium": lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a medium bitrate
* "low": lossy codecs such as MP3, AAC, ... in a lower bitrate

**NOTE: The `download_quality` really depends on the used modules, so check out the modules README.md**

`search_limit`: How many search results are shown


### Global/Formatting:

```json5
{
    "album_format": "{name}{explicit}",
    "playlist_format": "{name}{explicit}",
    "track_filename_format": "{track_number}. {name}",
    "single_full_path_format": "{name}",
    "enable_zfill": true,
    "force_album_format": false
}
```

`track_filename_format`: How tracks are formatted in albums and playlists. The relevant extension is appended to the end.

`album_format`, `playlist_format`, `artist_format`: Base directories for their respective formats - tracks and cover
art are stored here. May have slashes in it, for instance {artist}/{album}.

`single_full_path_format`: How singles are handled, which is separate to how the above work.
Instead, this has both the folder's name and the track's name.

`enable_zfill`: Enables zero padding for `track_number`, `total_tracks`, `disc_number`, `total_discs` if the
corresponding number has more than 2 digits

`force_album_format`: Forces the `album_format` for tracks instead of the `single_full_path_format` and also
uses `album_format` in the `playlist_format` folder 


#### Format variables

`track_filename_format` variables are `{name}`, `{album}`, `{album_artist}`, `{album_id}`, `{track_number}`,
`{total_tracks}`, `{disc_number}`, `{total_discs}`, `{release_date}`, `{release_year}`, `{artist_id}`, `{isrc}`,
`{upc}`, `{explicit}`, `{copyright}`, `{codec}`, `{sample_rate}`, `{bit_depth}`.

`album_format` variables are `{name}`, `{id}`, `{artist}`, `{artist_id}`, `{release_year}`, `{upc}`, `{explicit}`,
`{quality}`, `{artist_initials}`.

`playlist_format` variables are `{name}`, `{creator}`, `{tracks}`, `{release_year}`, `{explicit}`, `{creator_id}`

* `{quality}` will add
    ```
     [Dolby Atmos]
     [96kHz 24bit]
     [M]
    ```
 to the corresponding path (depending on the module)
* `{explicit}` will add
    ```
     [E]
    ```
  to the corresponding path

### Global/Covers

```json5
{
    "embed_cover": true,
    "main_compression": "high",
    "main_resolution": 1400,
    "save_external": false,
    "external_format": "png",
    "external_compression": "low",
    "external_resolution": 3000,
    "save_animated_cover": true
}
```

| Option               | Info                                                                                     |

### Global/Codecs

```json5
{
    "proprietary_codecs": false,
    "spatial_codecs": true
}
```

`proprietary_codecs`: Enable it to allow `MQA`, `E-AC-3 JOC` or `AC-4 IMS`

`spatial_codecs`: Enable it to allow `MPEG-H 3D`, `E-AC-3 JOC` or `AC-4 IMS`

**Note: `spatial_codecs` has priority over `proprietary_codecs` when deciding if a codec is enabled**

### Global/Module_defaults

```json5
{
    "lyrics": "default",
    "covers": "default",
    "credits": "default"
}
```

Change `default` to the module name under `/modules` in order to retrieve `lyrics`, `covers` or `credits` from the
selected module

### Global/Lyrics
```json5
{
    "embed_lyrics": true,
    "embed_synced_lyrics": false,
    "save_synced_lyrics": true

| embed_synced_lyrics | Embeds the synced lyrics inside every track (needs `embed_lyrics` to be enabled) (required for [Roon](https://community.roonlabs.com/t/1-7-lyrics-tag-guide/85182)) |
| save_synced_lyrics  | Saves the synced lyrics inside a  `.lrc` file in the same directory as the track with the same `track_format` variables                                             |

<!-- FORK DIFFERENCES -->
## Fork Differences

This is a forked project that has been modified from the original. Below are the changes made:

- Sanitized names now replace colons with hyphens.
- Sanitized names now allow the *$* character.
- The *silentremove* function has been updated to allow for the removal of directories in addition to files.
- The *AlbumInfo* class has added the fields *artists* and *artist_ids*.
- The *TrackInfo* class has replaced the field *artist_id* with *artist_ids*.
- The tagging process now includes *source* (set to *TIDAL*) and *timestamp* (set to the current epoch time) tags.
- The *_get_artist_initials_from_name* function now returns initials for all album artists, separated by a hyphen.
- The *_download_album_files* function supports the new *hardlink_multiple_artists* config option, and if enabled will hardlink the cover, animated cover, and description files to all album artists. If *hardlink_multiple_artists* is disabled, the original functionality will remain and only the first album artist will have these files.
- The *download_album* function supports the new *hardlink_multiple_artists* config option, and if enabled will hardlink the booklet file to all album artists. If *hardlink_multiple_artists* is disabled, the original functionality will remain and only the first album artist will have this file.
- The *download_track* and *tag_file* functions support the new *hardlink_multiple_artists* config option, and if enabled will hardlink the track file and failed tagging txt file (if applicable) to all album artists. If *hardlink_multiple_artists* is disabled, the original functionality will remain and only the first album artist will have these files.
- The print statement that comes after the "=== Downloading album ... ===" text has been updated to show all album artists rather than just the first one.
- The print statement that comes after the text "=== Downloading track ... ===" text has been updated to show all artists rather than just the first one.
- In the *download_album* function, if the album folder has no audio files after the download is complete (due to errors, skipped tracks, etc), the album folder will be deleted.
- The new *fixed_zfill* option allows the user to set the "zfill" number rather than it being set to the length of the total tracks metadata field.
- The *download_track* function now exposes the track ID in *track_tags* so the user can use it in the *track_filename_format* config option.
- In the *download_track* function, declaration of *album_info* has been moved outside of the if statement so that we can access it when creating hardlinks.
- Search results now append item IDs to each result.
